These recordings were done as a presentation for SORT 2011.

In order to play back these files you need ttyrec installed. I know it is
available on debian, and it should be available in redhat also. To playback
a file type:

ttyplay &lt;filename&gt;

If you run into problems while playing back the recording (like the lines
seem to get stuck on the last line) then you might need to set the size of
your terminal window to 80 columns and 39 rows. If your windows is taller 
or shorter it may not play back quite right.
